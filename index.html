        Hey all, I'm Lewis. I was born and raised in Ballard (North Seattle). I'm a big sports fan. Specifically I'm a big fan of the NBA because
        I grew up playing basketball, although you might not be able to tell if you met me in person becasue, well, let's just say I'm vertivally
        challenged. Due to that fact, I had to develop other interests outside of basketball. I watch a lot of movies and I especially love going
        to the theatre with my friends. I also listen to a lot of music. I'm mostly into hip-hop, but I like to think my taste is pretty ecclectic.

            Lately, I have also become enamored with travelling. Last summer my best friend and I went to Nicaragua to visit his brother who
            was working in the Peace Corps there at the time. Since then we have been to Iceland, the UK, France, the Netherlands, the
            Czech Republic, Hungary, and Austria.

            I graduated from Roosevelt High School in 2015. Following that, I spent a year at Washington State University before transferring
            to Shoreline Community College. I'm currently in the process of transferring to the University of Washington and I am so excited 
            to be in the Coding Bootcamp!
