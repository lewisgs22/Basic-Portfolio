        <img src="IMG_5137.jpg">

        <p>Hey all, I'm Lewis. I'm 22 years old and I was born and raised in Ballard (North Seattle).
        I am a pretty big sports fan. Specifically, I follow the NBA very closely because I grew up playing basketball.
        Although, that may come as a surprise if you've ever seen me in person because, well, let's just say
        I'm vertically challenged. Because of this I had to develop many interests outside of basketball.
        I love watching movies with my friends, especially when we go to the theatre and I'm super into music as well.
        I mostly enjoy hip-hop, but I like to think my taste is pretty ecclectic. 
            I graduated from Roosevelt highschool and following that spent one year at Washington State University
        before transferring to Shoreline Community College. I'm in the process of tranferring to the
        University of Washington and I'm so excited to be here in the Coding Bootcamp!</p>
